1. Open `ivdrip.html` or `vitals.html`.

2. Edit the information at the top, in between
`/* parameters that should be changed */` and `/* end of parameters */`.
This includes the expected numbers that should be entered,
the name of a drug for the IV machine, messages to show the player,
and the ARIS item ID to give to the player when they submit a correct answer.

3. Place the `.html` file on a web server.

4. In ARIS, place "web page" objects into a game, either as tabs or as objects
on the map. The URL should be wherever you put the `.html` file in step 3.
